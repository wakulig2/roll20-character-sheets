## Changelog

### Oct 14, 2020
- Added Readme with Changelog and other details
- Added 1/combat as an option for move frequencies
- Added Pokemon moves section to the Trainer sheet, since Trainers often use moves. Now this section is on all sheets.
- Revamped how move usage is tracked, to use buttons instead of checkboxes. Added this same tracker to Features.
- Changed Nature selection to a dropdown

### Oct 3, 2020
- Max HP now references the built in _max that allows it to be used for token health bars.
- Pokemon moves have been completely reorganized, and now have buttons to roll for accuracy and damage.
- The background now changes to match the Pokemon's type.
- Moves now change color to match the move's type.
- Resized some text boxes to better fit actual play.

### Sept 22, 2020
- Incorrect logo image was used, causing elements to be blocked. (It had a bunch of extra transparent space.) Replaced with the correct image.
- Special Defense for Pokemon was missing a line break, so if you opened the window too wide, the display would show on the same line and would no longer be in the ball. Added this missing line break.

### Sept 16, 2020
- Initial Commit


## To do list
- Display the full bonus to skill checks
- Allow modifications to movement (maybe just an extra box)
- Prevent critical range from going below 0 or above 20, maybe do similar to other fields
- Handle temp stat changes somehow, this may be a lot of work
