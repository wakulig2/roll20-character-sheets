	"instructions": "A character and city sheet designed for the Dresden Files Role-Playing Game. Designed to match the pen-and-paper sheets as much as possible by default, with toggleable options to expand/reorganize some fields for easier online play.\n\n\nIncludes two roll templates: descriptiveroll and simpleroll. Both templates accept a 'name' value for the character name, a optional 'verb' value that comes after the name (for example, 'Steve rolls...'), and a 'check' value that is the title of the roll (typically, the skill rolled).\n\nThe descriptiveroll template outputs a 'roll' value that evaluates to a number into a description based on the Fate ladder; for example, '{{roll=[[4]]}}' would display 'Great (+4)'. Any other values are included below the roll result. The simpleroll template skips the ladder result display, but is otherwise identical.\n\n\nUses the same attribute names as the DFRPG sheet by Brian Shields, so the two sheets are mostly compatible if you want to switch between them. The only major incompatibility is the skill list, which functions completely differently here."
