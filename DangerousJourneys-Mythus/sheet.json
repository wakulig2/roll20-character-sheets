The first checkbox next to each K/S is whether your HP possesess the K/S Area, and the second checkbox is whether the K/S area generates Heka.  You can keep the Heka generation checkboxes at their default settings, but some (Ecology/Nature Science for Wisemen/Wisewomen) vary by Vocation or by GM fiat, so the options exist. \n  Ignore ShadowAttrs, as they are a debug tool which will enentually not be visible.\n  For now you need to type all armor and weapons in manually; eventually there will be an importer, as there will be for Castings.\n  The K/S area for Foreign Language is initially invisible but a button exists on the K/S tab which allows you to add multiple Foreign Languages as needed.\n"
