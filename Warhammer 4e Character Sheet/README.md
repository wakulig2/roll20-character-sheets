# Warhammer 4e Character Sheet (Djjus)

This is a fork of https://github.com/vicberg/Roll20-Warhammer-4e-Character-Sheet, which itself is a port of a original WHFRP2e Template.

This Character Sheet has been updated to fix and enhance mostly in the original style. And uploaded to Roll20 for all to use. 
I'm a active WFRP player and I plan to further enhance this sheet at time goes on.


///// ============ Change Log ============ ///// 

October 12th 2020 v1.23

- translation.json update, attempting to fix the translation issue which was introduced last week which prevent the new json from use on the live server sheet.
- Fixed issue with Heavy Head armor capping at 1 carried Enc.


October 5th 2020 v1.23

- Further modification of how Armor tab works. Worn? check will now add/remove ENC and AP appropriately. Some descriptive text has been added to these sections too.
- Continued adding IL8N tags that were missing from a lot of the new content. This work is now mostly complete.
- Workable Italian translation is now implemented (Translation credit to Andrezzo/Roll20). (change language to Italian on Roll20 website/account config, then start server to see it). I am more then willing to work with others to implement more languages, but can not do this by myself.


September 7th 2020 v1.22

- Fixed issue which stoped the Initiative button from working correctly on a newly created character sheet.
- Added numerious IL8N tags that were missing from alot of the new content. This is a work in progress to enable high quality custom translation to be added later. Italian translation is being worked on by the 3rd party.

July 27 2020 - v1.1

NEW - Condition Tracking full implementation, now adds up Multiple Conditions correctly as per the rule book. Meaning only one (highest) condition will be added to the roll template Automatically. Also changed the setting description to clarify this.
NEW - Expandable Packs, Containers & Vehicle section added under Inventory Tab. Allows for simple separation of carried and non-carried items, in Packs & Vehicles. Separate weight calc built in. Container with Enc now add to Total Character Enc too. (Great for any sort of travel heavy stories, e.g. Death on the Reik!)

July 13 2020 - v1.0

- Major Art overhaul -  in style of the rule book, removed the black banners and reworked section titles, new background for all themes. Overall effect is less contrast and more white space. Easier on the Eyes.
- Weapons Tab overhaul - Weapons must now be selected to use them, and will fire of from the new Attack/Opposed/Shoot buttons. This should be fairly obvious when the Player next tries to use a weapon after this update. This feature is supported by new sheetworkers. This allows using weapons outside the Weapons reaping sections which is the main reason this was implemented.
- Combat Actions section overhaul - Added custom roll field, core rule based movement rolls for Athletics/Climbing/Falling/Leaping/Pursuit/Sprinting in drop-down menu, current active Attack/Opposed/Shoot display and buttons which are underpinend by the new Weapons mechanic.
- And a number of minor bug fixes


July 5 2020

- Overburdened value now correctly increments when you go over the max encumbrance value, rather then at max encumbrance value.
- Sturdy value now is correctly adds x2 per level to encumbrance
- Character Armor Arm & Leg encumbrance is now linked to avoid confusion of adding too much enc. (right arm/leg enc attributes are now deprecated)


June 29 2020

- Buttons & Banners further improved look
- Combat Initiative roll now allows Modifier for the Init Char.
- Crit Roll fixed so it doesnt go negative.
- NPC tab reworked, look improved, added Condition tracker section and 2 custom skill rolls
- Condition Tracking integration into roll template, first pass. Option to choose between Advantage +xx showing only (new default) on all combat rolls and all non-situational roll modifying conditions (e.g. Broken, Fatigued Stuned, Prone..) to be add to appropriate rolls automatically. Includes NPC tab support too. It should be noted that some conditons can we highly situational, like Perception test could be impacted by Blinded/Deafened or not depending on what is being percived, such situational occasions will have to be handled by the GM and no attempt is made to add complication. 

Condition effects are currently bound as follows:

Broken/Fatigued/Poisoned/Stunned = Effects all Melee/Spellcast and skill rolls (only excludes roll tables like Misscast/Oops etc.)
Entangled/Prone = Effects Movement based rolls, so melee/spells, combat actions and any skill which would require movement like dodge/athletics/climb etc.
Blinded = Effects Weapon/Spells casts rolls
Deafened = Effects Spells casts rolls
Unconscious = Effects all rolls (Effectively blocks rolling with buttons)

Note conditions are not inteneded for out of combat situations, GM simply make the roll difficulty harder (-20 etc) if any condition is to apply to a situation.

Dec 24 2019

- Project Forked from https://github.com/vicberg/Roll20-Warhammer-4e-Character-Sheet



Features:

- Attack / Opposed / Ranged Seprated combat sytem with roll template which relevant information

- Skill system, Basic / Advanced Skill List is fully implemented

- Armor system with Enc, AP and Damage tracking

- Spell book system, with core book spell name list, and optional custom spell function.

- SL indicator for all rolls, also aids manual calculation for opposed rolls (due underlying limits with Roll20 full Opposed SL resolution is not a straight forward matter for now, i have chosen the visual self calcualted approach while providing the maximum possible information in miminal mouse clicks to enable that easily.)

- Advantage & Condition Tracking

- Full Encumbrance Management system 

- Cointainer & Vehicle carry space Management

- Roll Table integration for Critical / Oops / Miscast & Wrath of the God


Usage Notes:


- SETTING: Check setting (cog) tab ever time when setting up any new Char sheet for all players, and select correct options for your game.
- Wounds: ensure correct Race and Hardy level are chosen. Wounds are subtracted by adding damage, and given back by subtracting it. Will not go our of 0-Max Wounds range.
- Advantage Field applied to Attacks and appropriate Combat Skills (Cool & Dodge) automatically, and shows i the roll result.
- For an advanced Skill you must select the taken checkbox in order for target to be above 0.
- On Weapons ensure you select the coresponding skill (e.g. Melee Basic, Melee Parrying, Ranged Bow, Ranged Blackpowder etc), and that the correct skill is learned and advance points in it.
- Themes, see setting tab for various theme which change the look of the char sheet overall. Inclung Emprie/Dwarf & Elf themes.
- Arcane Spells need to have a number in CN and Damage Field or they will not roll correctly, both fields will default to Zero.
- Extended Channelling Test (spellbook tab, Arcane Spells only), set Accu Ext SL to 0 before beginning a new Channelling action. Increment with Success level of roll until finished. Allows easy tracking of CN v Accu Ext SL for all players. (NPC tab has channelling on all spells for simplicity)
- NPC tab is intended of quick persistent and contained NPC creation without the need for full character sheets for each of them. With template integration, semi featured with contained Name / Characteristic / Condition / Advantage ingration and up to 5 weapons & spells for each NPC, and a collapsible notes section. Good for GMs and players. (I would still recommed seperate character sheet for actual NPC bosses/major characters). 
- Condition Tracking integration into roll template, first pass. Option to choose between Advantage +xx showing only (new default) on all combat rolls and all non-situational roll modifying conditions (e.g. Broken, Fatigued Stuned, Prone..) to be add to appropriate rolls automatically. Includes NPC tab support too. 

This has TokenMod integrated (TokenMod API needs to be install in the game!) buttons which can set/unset conditions, it also requires my custom WFRP4e Tokens  (download @ https://github.com/Djjus/Vault/blob/master/Warhammer%204e%20Character%20Sheet/markers/WFRP4eset1.0.zip) 

It should be noted that some conditons can we highly situational, like Perception test could be impacted by Blinded/Deafened or not depending on what is being perceived, such situational occasions will have to be handled by the GM and no attempt to add complication is made. 

Condition effects are currently bound as follows:

Broken/Fatigued/Poisoned/Stunned = Effects all Melee/Spellcast and skill rolls (only excludes roll tables like Misscast/Oops etc.)
Entangled/Prone = Effects Movement based rolls, all Melee/Spellcast, combat actions and any skill which would require movement like dodge/athletics/climb etc.
Blinded = Effects Weapon & Spells casts rolls
Deafened = Effects Spells casts rolls
Unconscious = Effects all rolls except endurance (Roll block essentially)

Multiple condtions: You can be subject to the same Condition more than once; indeed, sometimes you will receive multiples of the same Condition from a single event. If this occurs, any penalties suffered are stacked. So, if you have three Bleeding Conditions, you’re losing a worrying 3 Wounds per Round; or if you have 3 Fatigued Conditions, you suffer –30 to all Tests. You can also be subject to multiple, different Conditions at once. When thisoccurs, the effects do not stack; you suffer the highest of the two penalties and apply it. So, if you had the Fatigued and Prone Conditions, you would suffer a –20 penalty to all active Tests, not –30.

Note conditions are not inteneded for out of combat situations, GM simply makes the roll difficulty harder with a custom roll modifier (-20 etc) if any particular condition is to apply to a situational roll.




Future release wish list :

- More themes. (v1.3)
- Talents Tab rework, with possible roll integration. (v1.3)
- WFRP 4e Roll API with SL resolution API. (v1.x)



Enjoy.
