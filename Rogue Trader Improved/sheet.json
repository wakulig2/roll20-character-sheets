	"instructions": "This sheet is designed for use in Roll20 to play the Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader pen & paper RPG by Fantasy Flight Games. Based on the Dark Heresy 2nd Edition Character Sheet created by Daniel D., Michael R and Samuel L.\r\rThis version is a massive expansion of both functionality and style that **does Not require API scripts**.\r\r**Dice interpretation:** Percentile dice rolls follow this basic formula\r\r'(@{characteristic}+?{modifiers}-1d100cs1cf100)/10'\r\rThe roll template interprets any positive result as a success (including 0) any negative results are failures, the results are divided by 10 (by the macro) to provide the *Degree(s) of Success (or failure)*.\r\rThe results have decimal numbers, **this is intentional** (limitations of macros math functions), *just ignore them*.\r\rSome fields auto calculate values based on the **Characteristic Bonus field** (the small box at the corner of the Characteristic number) remember to fill these fields accordingly.\r\rMany fields and checkboxes across the sheet have **information tooltips that show up when you point at them with the mouse cursor**, very useful information there check them out!.\r\rMany fields also include a white text area to copy and paste descriptions, these fields can be hidden/displayed with the corresponding **checkbox**, they can also be shown in the chat by clicking the **Show** button.\r\rThese fields can also include *Inline Rolls*, in case there is a roll as a part of an item/talent effect. The inline rolls must always be written in between **double square brackets [[ ]]**, these rolls will be seen on the chat when using the **Show** button.\r\rIf you want to create your own custom macros using this character sheet's roll template, use &{template:custom}, the first line uses {{name=}} the roll result line uses {{result=}} and the description field uses {{desc=}}, the other lines simply follow {{insert title here = insert value here}}.\r\rThe sheet is best displayed on the Roll20 supported browsers Chrome and Firefox, at 100% Zoom (no zoom basically) and inside the roll20 screen, however it can be expanded or dislayed on an external window with no problems, most elements will strech-out to fill the screen without breaking.\r\r**IMPORTANT TIP: The roll template is best displayed in chat when turning off the ENABLE CHAT AVATARS option in the My Settings tab of the game settings.**\r\rIf you have any questions or suggestions, send a private message to https://app.roll20.net/users/986445/mago \r\rVer: 1.1 8/29/20"
