# TODO
- Combo-boxes for Characteristic & Skills, leading to auto-determination of goal numbers for Combat actions, Psi powers, Theurgy rituals, etc..
  including update of pre-existing Characteristic & Skills values (entered manually in the user's language)

- migrate wyrd/vita radio button layou to https://wiki.roll20.net/CSS_Wizardry#Fill_Radio_Buttons_to_the_Left
  also prevention selection to go higher than the max

- ability for users to report a bug found in the sheet (or suggest this as general function to Roll20 team)

- Ensure a 1 is always a success, despite a high malus

- Improve instructions in sheet.json with markdown

- Allow choice b/w public vs GM roll

- update selected_skill_value when a non-repeating skill value changes (done already for repeating creative/lore skills)

- add a section for Body Modifications (incl. Cyberware)

- add a section for Movement (default: 5)

- add a section for Languages

- Initiative roll query - translations from English

- Vitality critical levels (-2 to -10) to affect goal numbers

- Weapons & armors property checkboxes (Shock, Laser, Plasma, etc..) & replace d6rolls with proper damage/armor rolls showing shield-piercing vs normal damage, etc.

- Support for Symbiot characters

# Nice-to-have
- Infoboxes, e.g. how to compute init, wyrd, vita...

- Fading Suns Logo
